CM9 Device Tree for Huawei Ideos X5 (U8800)

Not Working:
1 - WiFi
2 - Bluetooth (It shows turned up but it doesn't discover any device and doesn't connect)
3 - Camera (It's working but doesn't detect SD Card so cannot take picture or video)
4 - Gallery (It doesn't create thumbails)

Other thinks are working good.
